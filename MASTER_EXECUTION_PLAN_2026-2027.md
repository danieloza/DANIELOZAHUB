# MASTER EXECUTION PLAN (Run Everything In Parallel)

Start: 2026-02-19  
Mode: parallel execution  
Rule: no random tasks; every task must move at least one KPI.

## 1) Parallel Workstreams

Workstream A: Acquisition (traffic + inbound)
- Goal: increase qualified lead volume (MQL).
- Weekly outputs: 3-5 short-form assets, 1 case update, 1 CTA test.
- KPI: MQL, CTR to contact, organic sessions.

Workstream B: Conversion (site + funnel)
- Goal: increase lead-to-call and form completion.
- Weekly outputs: 1 UX improvement, 1 form/CTA experiment, full mobile QA.
- KPI: form completion rate, lead-to-call, drop-off points.

Workstream C: Sales Ops (speed + close rate)
- Goal: respond faster and close more deals.
- Weekly outputs: SLA review, follow-up automation check, lost-reason cleanup.
- KPI: time-to-first-response, call-to-client, pipeline hygiene.

Workstream D: Offer/Productization (margin + retention)
- Goal: push revenue mix toward core/high-ticket offers.
- Weekly outputs: package iteration, 1 proposal/case asset, pricing validation.
- KPI: average deal size, gross margin, retainer share.

## 2) 30-Day Sprint (All Streams Active)

Week 1
- A: publish 3 assets + 1 case CTA post.
- B: fix top 3 funnel UX blockers and mobile issues.
- C: enforce first-response SLA under 2h on working days.
- D: lock offer ladder (entry/core/scale) with clear scope.

Week 2
- A: run 2 hook variants on highest-intent offer.
- B: run A/B test for primary CTA path.
- C: implement 24h and 72h follow-up templates.
- D: publish one-page proposal template and update pricing matrix.

Week 3
- A: segment content by 3 verticals (local/ecom/creator).
- B: replace bottom 2 CTA blocks by performance.

- D: publish one premium case with concrete business result.

Week 4
- A: keep cadence and cut low-performing formats.
- B: monthly funnel review with conversion deltas.
- C: pipeline cleanup + owner reassignment.
- D: decide scale/hold/kill for each offer line.

## 3) Weekly Execution Cadence

Monday (planning, 45 min)
- choose top 5 tasks across streams.
- freeze scope (no extra tasks unless blocker).

Wednesday (checkpoint, 30 min)
- verify KPI trend and unblock owners.

Friday (review, 45 min)
- what shipped, what moved KPI, what to cut next week.

## 4) Non-Negotiable Rules

- One KPI owner per stream.
- No task without measurable expected impact.
- If weekly completion < 70%: no new initiatives next week.
- If KPI is flat 2 weeks: replace tactic, keep objective.
